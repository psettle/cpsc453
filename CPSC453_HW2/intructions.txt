======== Build Instructions ===========

------ Windows --------
Open ../CPSC453_HW1.sln with visualstudio 2017
Select CPSC453_HW1 in the solution explorer
Switch to Release mode
Menu -> Build -> Clean
Menu -> Build -> Build

To run: ctrl + F5


------ Linux ---------
In this folder:
make clean
make all
./out/cpsc453_hw1.exe

(Tested on cpsc labs, other linux system may be missing libraries)

========= Usage Instructions ===========

Use "Up Arrow" and "Down Arrow" to cycle through the scenes/parts of the assignment

All scenes accept user input in the form of an integer, whether that is #iterations, #points, #spiral, etc.
	- Type the desired number for the scene, then press enter. (While having window focus on this application)
	- The number you entered will be echo'd on the console window, along with an error message in the case of invalid input
		- Possible invalid input is failing to enter any digits, or entering a number too big for the current scene.
		- The input detection is pretty amateur, it will not register a key until it is released, and will not register a key if another number is already pressed, take it slow.

To exit, click the close button, or Alt + F4 (Windows). I didn't hook up the esc key.
